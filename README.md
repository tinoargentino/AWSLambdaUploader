# AWSLambdaUploader
Bash script that commits changes to a Github repository, creates zip file and uploads it to AWS Lambda

# Instructions
Run this script in a folder 1 level above of the folder that contains the AWS Deployment (script and dependencies, credential files, etc)

If you have a credentials file that you want to leave out of Github, you should leave it 1 level above the Deployment folder

Credentials or secret files: Read the comments in the code

For the rest of customizations, follow instructions in the script

AWS: Works with AWS Cli 2, and configured with your credentials and region.
